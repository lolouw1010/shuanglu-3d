Public URL: https://shuanglu.uway.click
Public /3d: https://shuanglu.uway.click/3d
Health check: https://shuanglu.uway.click/health
Tailscale node: linode-singapore
Public IP: 139.162.57.49
Application root: /opt/apps/shuanglu
Active release: /opt/apps/shuanglu/current
Internal address: 127.0.0.1:3002
Service: shuanglu.service

Reverse proxy: Docker container nginx
Nginx host config: /home/web/conf.d/shuanglu.uway.click.conf
Certificate host directory: /home/web/certs
```

SSH is available through Tailscale. Public TCP port 22 is intentionally blocked.

```bash

ssh root@linode-singapore
```

Tracked production templates:

```txt
ops/systemd/shuanglu.service
ops/systemd/shuanglu-certbot-renew.service
ops/systemd/shuanglu-certbot-renew.timer
ops/nginx/shuanglu.uway.click.conf
ops/scripts/deploy-certificate.sh
```

### Release Procedure

The supported release command is:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

It requires:

- A clean `main` working tree.
- Local `HEAD` equal to `origin/main`.
- Node.js 20 selected through `.nvmrc`.
- Working Tailscale SSH access to `root@linode-singapore`.

The script performs:

1. Local clean-tree and revision checks.
2. Local clean install, typecheck, tests, and production build.
3. Git archive upload into a new independent release directory.
4. Server-side clean install and production build.
5. Temporary-port smoke checks for `/` and `/3d`.
6. Atomic `current` symlink switch.
7. `shuanglu.service` restart and internal HTTP check.
8. Public `/health`, `/`, and `/3d` checks.
9. Automatic restoration of the previous release if the live service fails.

Each release contains a `REVISION` file. Verify the deployed revision with:

```bash
ssh root@linode-singapore 'cat /opt/apps/shuanglu/current/REVISION'
```

### Manual Verification

```bash
./scripts/production-health-check.sh
ssh root@linode-singapore 'systemctl status shuanglu --no-pager'
ssh root@linode-singapore 'docker exec nginx nginx -t'
```

### TLS Renewal

Let's Encrypt uses the webroot `/var/www/letsencrypt`. The `shuanglu-certbot-renew.timer` unit runs the pinned `certbot/certbot:v5.6.0` container twice daily. A successful renewal runs `/usr/local/sbin/deploy-shuanglu-certificate`, which updates the certificate files mounted into the Nginx container, validates the Nginx configuration, and reloads Nginx.

Verification:

```bash
ssh root@linode-singapore 'systemctl list-timers shuanglu-certbot-renew.timer --no-pager'
ssh root@linode-singapore 'docker run --rm --network host -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt -v /home/web/letsencrypt:/var/www/letsencrypt certbot/certbot:v5.6.0 renew --dry-run --no-random-sleep-on-renew --cert-name shuanglu.uway.click'
```

### Runtime State

Online rooms are in memory only. Restarting `shuanglu.service` clears active rooms. Shuanglu currently has no production database or user-upload directory.

## Historical: Aliyun GD Deployment

Status: retired after migration to Linode. The remaining sections are historical recovery and deployment records; do not use them for current releases.

Deployment target:

- Public URL: `http://47.121.182.144/`
- Server: `47.121.182.144`
- SSH user: `root`
- Application path: `/opt/shuanglu`
- Internal app address: `127.0.0.1:3002`
- Process manager: PM2
- PM2 process name: `shuanglu`
- Reverse proxy: Nginx
- Nginx config file: `/etc/nginx/conf.d/shuanglu.conf`
- Deployment source: local working-tree archive for latest visual pass; earlier deployments used local Git archives.

Runtime model:

1. Build and run the Next.js application as a Node process.
2. Bind the app to `127.0.0.1:3002`.
3. Use Nginx as the public reverse proxy on port `80`.
4. Match the IP host `47.121.182.144` in a dedicated Nginx server block.
5. Leave the existing `college.hkuway.com` server block in place.

Server commands used:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/shuanglu
tar -xzf /tmp/shuanglu-deploy-b7b9e55.tgz -C /opt/shuanglu
cd /opt/shuanglu
npm ci
npm run build
pm2 start npm --name shuanglu -- start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3002
pm2 save
nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
```

Verification:

```bash
curl -I --max-time 10 http://127.0.0.1:3002/
```

Result:

```txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

```bash
curl -s --max-time 20 http://47.121.182.144/
```

Result:

```txt
The public response contains <title>双陆 Shuanglu.
```

Operational notes:

- The server's existing Nginx config already serves `college.hkuway.com`.
- The Shuanglu app uses a separate Nginx server block for `47.121.182.144`, so the existing site was not intentionally replaced.
- The server could not reliably fetch the GitHub repository directly during deployment, so the deployed package was uploaded from the local verified Git commit.
- `npm ci` reported 7 moderate severity dependency advisories. They were not auto-fixed because `npm audit fix --force` may introduce breaking changes.

## 2026-05-01 Recovery Notes

After deploying the bar re-entry UX fix, the server became unresponsive during an interrupted dependency install. The instance was rebooted from the Aliyun console.

Observed after reboot:

- Nginx was online.
- Public HTTP returned `502 Bad Gateway`.
- PM2 process `shuanglu` was repeatedly restarting.
- `pm2 logs shuanglu` showed `next: not found`, then `Bus error (core dumped)` after a partial repair attempt.

Recovery steps:

```bash
pm2 stop shuanglu
cd /opt/shuanglu
mv node_modules node_modules.broken_20260501_183014
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
mkdir -p /opt/shuanglu_backups
mv /opt/shuanglu/node_modules.broken_* /opt/shuanglu_backups/
npm run build
pm2 restart shuanglu --update-env
pm2 save
```

Important operational lesson:

- Do not leave backup directories such as `node_modules.broken_*` inside the Next.js project root. Next.js/TypeScript may scan them during build.
- If a dependency install is interrupted, prefer moving `node_modules` out of the app directory and running a clean `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund`.

Recovery verification:

```bash
curl -I --max-time 10 http://127.0.0.1:3002/
curl -I --max-time 20 http://47.121.182.144/
```

Result:

```txt
Both internal Next.js and public Nginx endpoints returned HTTP 200.
The public JavaScript bundle contains 点这里复马.
```

## 2026-05-03 Visual Board Deployment

Public JavaScript bundle contains board-scene, board-shell, board-perspective, and white-horse-idle.
```

Open deployment note:

- This deployment used the local working tree for the server cutover, then the same visual changes were committed and pushed to GitHub as `47d6f60`.

## 2026-05-03 Online Room Deployment

Status: deployed.

## 2026-06-11 Parchment 2D Interface Deployment

Status: deployed.

Purpose:

- Publish the light parchment 2D interface pass based on the approved reference composition.
- Keep the existing rules engine, AI logic, online room model, and isolated `/3d` route unchanged.

## 2026-06-11 2D State Reference Deployment

Status: deployed to Aliyun GD; GitHub synced; BigNAS push pending.

Purpose:

- Publish the refined 2D parchment state layout based on two additional state reference images.
- Reduce the 2D top HUD to round/current action plus dice.
- Move borne-off and bar state emphasis into side-panel circular tracks.

Git mirror note:

```txt
GitHub main: bcf8e2f
BigNAS main: f9cb3b2
```

`git push bignas main` hung twice during receive-pack. `git ls-remote bignas refs/heads/main` still responded, so the NAS remote is reachable but not currently accepting the push reliably. Retry BigNAS sync later before relying on it as current.

Resolution on 2026-06-12:

```txt
git push --progress bignas main succeeded.
GitHub main: 092ace8
BigNAS main: 092ace8
```

## 2026-06-12 Reference Portrait Deployment

Status: deployed to Aliyun GD; GitHub synced; BigNAS synced after a later retry with progress output.

Purpose:

- Replace the 2D side-panel portraits with crops from the user-provided reference UI.
- Fix the live game-state crop problem where character heads could be hidden.
- Move portrait rendering from `object-fit: cover` to `object-fit: contain` so heads and upper bodies remain visible.

POST move applied a legal white move from 12 to 6 and updated moveHistory.
```

Operational note:

- Online rooms are in-memory in the Next.js Node process. Restarting PM2 clears active rooms.

## 2026-05-04 3D Isolated Test Route Deployment

Status: deployed.

Source commit:

```txt
7f73e37 Isolate 3D table test route
```

Purpose:

- Keep the stable online play flow on `/`.
- Add the experimental 3D table scene behind `/3d` and the `3D测试` menu entry.
- Add shareable online room links using `?room=<ROOM_ID>`.

Deployment package:

```txt

```

Operational notes:

- `camera-controls@3.1.0`, pulled by the 3D dependency stack, warns that it prefers Node >=20.11.0. The server currently runs Node 18.19.1. The production build passed, but runtime QA on `/3d` is still required.
- The stable online play flow remains available on `/`; `/3d` is experimental.

## 2026-05-05 3D Horse Scale Deployment

Status: deployed after Aliyun instance reboot and recovery.

Purpose:

- Publish the `/3d` horse-to-board scale correction.
- Stop local development services so the user's laptop does not keep running the WebGL dev server.

Local actions completed:

- Stopped local project listeners on `127.0.0.1:3001` and `127.0.0.1:3004`.
- Verified no local listener remained on ports `3001` or `3004`.
- Ran local production build successfully:

```bash
npm run build
```

Result:

```txt
Next.js production build passed.
Routes include / and /3d.
```

Deployment package:

```txt
/tmp/shuanglu-3d-scale-20260505_1458.tgz
```

Server upload target:

```txt
/tmp/shuanglu-3d-scale-20260505_1458.tgz
```

Server release directory:

```txt
/opt/shuanglu_release_3d_scale_20260505_1458
```

Server actions completed before blockage:

```bash
scp /tmp/shuanglu-3d-scale-20260505_1458.tgz root@47.121.182.144:/tmp/shuanglu-3d-scale-20260505_1458.tgz
mkdir -p /opt/shuanglu_release_3d_scale_20260505_1458 /opt/shuanglu_backups
tar -xzf /tmp/shuanglu-3d-scale-20260505_1458.tgz -C /opt/shuanglu_release_3d_scale_20260505_1458
cd /opt/shuanglu_release_3d_scale_20260505_1458
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
```

Initial blockage:

- `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` emitted Node engine warnings already known from prior deployments, then stopped producing output.
- SSH later failed with `Connection timed out during banner exchange`.
- Public HTTP verification also timed out.
- The SSH session running `npm ci` ended with `Connection reset by peer`.

Important state boundary:

- Production PM2 cutover was not executed.
- `/opt/shuanglu` was not intentionally replaced during this attempt.
- No `pm2 restart shuanglu` or `systemctl reload nginx` command was reached.

Required recovery:

1. Reboot or recover the Aliyun instance from the provider console if SSH remains unavailable.
2. After SSH returns, inspect and stop any leftover `npm ci` process.
3. Prefer a lightweight release path because this version did not add dependencies:
   - copy `/opt/shuanglu/node_modules` into `/opt/shuanglu_release_3d_scale_20260505_1458`, or
   - run `npm ci` only after confirming the server has enough free memory and I/O headroom.
4. Build the release, then cut over PM2 only after `npm run build` succeeds.

Recovery completed:

- User rebooted the Aliyun instance from the provider side.
- SSH and public TCP connectivity recovered.
- Server uptime after recovery showed low load.
- The partial `node_modules` left by the interrupted install was incomplete and failed `next build` with `next: not found`.
- The partial dependency directory was moved out of the release root to:

```txt
/opt/shuanglu_backups/partial_node_modules/node_modules.partial_20260505_2000
```

- Copied the known-good dependency directory from current production:

```bash
cp -a /opt/shuanglu/node_modules /opt/shuanglu_release_3d_scale_20260505_1458/node_modules
```

- Rebuilt the release successfully:

```bash
cd /opt/shuanglu_release_3d_scale_20260505_1458
npm run build
```

Result:

```txt
Next.js production build passed.
Routes include / and /3d.
```

Production cutover completed:

```bash

```

Build artifact check:

```txt
.next/static/chunks/289.18259aa6c1daf79d.js contains 博物复原桌面.
.next/static/chunks/289.18259aa6c1daf79d.js contains scale:o?.4:.35.
```

Operational notes:

- Historical `shuanglu-error.log` still contains old `next: not found`, `Bus error`, and stale Server Action lines from earlier deployments. The current restart output shows `next start` ready on `127.0.0.1:3002`.
- The partial dependency directory must remain outside `/opt/shuanglu`; keeping broken dependency backups in a project root can make Next.js scan them during build.


## 2026-05-08 2D Usability Deployment

Purpose:

- Deploy the 2D board usability pass that restores clearer source selection and legal landing feedback after the bottle-shaped piece update.
- Preserve the MiniMac cloud-only runtime policy: no local Next.js service was started.

## 2026-06-15 Point/Layout Fix Deployment Attempt

Purpose:

- Deploy the 2D board point/horse coordination and portrait head-crop fix.
- Preserve gameplay logic; this was a visual-only pass.

Source state:

```txt
Working tree after local point/layout edits.
```

Local artifact:

```txt
/tmp/shuanglu-point-layout-fix-20260615214151.tgz
```

Local verification before deployment:

```txt
npx tsc --noEmit passed.
npm test passed: 10 test files, 38 tests.
npm run build passed.
```

Deployment result:

```txt
Incomplete / unverified.
```

Observed failure mode:

- The archive upload completed and the remote deployment command started.
- Remote output reached tar extraction and npm engine warnings.
- The SSH session then stopped producing output.
- A separate HTTP check to `http://47.121.182.144/` timed out after 10 seconds.
- Repeated SSH checks timed out during banner exchange.
- Local hung SSH sessions were terminated to avoid leaving Codex with active stalled processes.

Recovery requirement:

```txt
When Aliyun SSH recovers, inspect /opt/shuanglu, pm2 status, nginx status, and disk usage.
If /opt/shuanglu is incomplete or PM2 is unhealthy, restore from the latest good backup or rerun deployment.
Do not mark this visual fix as cloud-deployed until HTTP 200, PM2 online, Nginx test, and a fresh cloud screenshot are captured.
```

## 2026-06-16 Aliyun Reboot Recovery

Trigger:

- The interrupted point/layout deployment left `/opt/shuanglu` incomplete.
- After the user rebooted the server, SSH became reachable again.

Observed broken state:

```txt
/opt/shuanglu existed but had no .next directory.
PM2 process shuanglu was online but restarting repeatedly.
PM2 error log showed: sh: 1: next: not found.
Nginx was active and nginx -t passed.
Root filesystem: 40G total, 11G used, 28G available, 28% used.
```

Recovery:

```txt
pm2 stop shuanglu
mv /opt/shuanglu /opt/shuanglu_backups/shuanglu_broken_after_reboot_20260616_001132
cp -a /opt/shuanglu_backups/shuanglu_before_point_layout_fix_20260615_214256 /opt/shuanglu
pm2 restart shuanglu --update-env
pm2 save
nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
```

Recovered runtime:

```txt
PM2 shuanglu online.
127.0.0.1:3002 returned HTTP 200.
http://47.121.182.144/ returned HTTP 200.
Cloud room A9D96C created.
Cloud screenshot captured at /tmp/shuanglu-screens/game-recovery-check-20260616001747.png.
```

Deployment rule update:

- Do not delete or replace `/opt/shuanglu` before the new release has built successfully.
- Future deploys should build in a separate release directory, then atomically switch or copy the verified release into place.
- Keep the previous complete runtime until the new runtime returns HTTP 200 through Nginx.

## 2026-06-17 Board Texture Hotfix

Purpose:

- Remove the large left/right side circles baked into the 2D parchment board texture.
- Avoid a full application deployment because only one static public PNG changed.

Changed asset:

```txt
public/assets/ui/2d-board-texture.png
```

Local verification:

```txt
npx tsc --noEmit passed.
npm test passed: 10 test files, 38 tests.

```

Runtime impact:

```txt
PM2 was not restarted.
No application code or build directory was replaced.
PM2 shuanglu remained online.
```

Verification:

```txt

## 2026-05-21 Expert AI Pressure Deployment

Purpose:

- Deploy a stronger Human vs AI expert profile after playtest feedback that the AI was too passive and easy to beat.
- Add heuristic pressure for tactical hitting, bar containment, re-entry blocking, consecutive made-point runs, and more aggressive tempo while preserving the stable 2D UI.
- Preserve the MiniMac cloud-only runtime policy: no local Next.js service was started.

## 2026-05-22 Automatic Pass Notice Deployment

Purpose:

- Deploy clearer turn-pass messaging after playtest confusion about white turns ending before re-entry or before all dice appeared to be used.
- Preserve rule behavior: a turn still ends when no legal move exists for the current dice.
- Make blocked bar re-entry and unusable remaining dice explicit in local, AI, and online play.
- Preserve the MiniMac cloud-only runtime policy: no local Next.js service was started.
